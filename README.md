# Tea Factory Management System
 Technologies used - Python using Django Framework
 
 
This project is based on a tea **factory management system**. Through this system, the factory will be able to **automate processes** like,
- Managing employee details and attendance
- Calculating employee salary
- Supplier details 
- Supplier payments
- Manage inventory
- Manage leaf stock details
- Final auction stock details
- Keep vehicle records
- Vehicle service cost

And, it allows the factory outlet to easily handle their **sales and stock activities**.


The system was developed using **Python** language and **Django** framework. 
With this webbased system, the user can easily access the system through the internet. This is a huge advantage for the user, as it keeps the user updated on the processes that are going on in the factory and in the outlet. Therefore, the productivity and efficiency of the factory is gradually increased through this system.
